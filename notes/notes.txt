╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have python3-full installed.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.
    
    See /usr/share/doc/python3.12/README.venv for more information.


sudo apt install python3.12

The API output will give you the snapshot of the current orderbook for the market associated with the ticker. So in your case, "KXHIGHDEN-25JAN06-T38" is the market "37 or below" on Kalshi. The convention followed by the API is that the orderbook is quoted in terms of a list of [price, quantity] bids. In your case, "yes":[[1,8738],[2,417]..] means there are 8738 bids for a "yes" contract at a price of 1 cent, 417 bids for a "yes" contract at a price of 2 cents, etc. This differs from how the frontent of the website displays things by default, where it typically shows the quotes in ask format. So the 8738 bids for "yes" at a price of 1 cent are equivalent (and usually displayed by the frontend as) 8738 asks for a "no" contract at a price of 99 cents.
